Ever looked at an old laptop and thought to yourself "I should turn that into a server". 

Well so did I.. and I might've taken it to far.

It actually started with a raspberry pi and a Jellyfin server and an inpatient girlfriend. Turns out transcoding video on the go is not a task the little fellow is really up to and nothing like lag to ruin movie night. 

The capability to add more storage isn't great either, but then I remembered my old gaming laptop collecting dust. Laptops make decent servers as their chipsets generally are low powered, but adding storage isn't triviel. For one most of them lack additional sata ports and you can only go so far with 1-2 2.5" drives. 

But the hardest piece of the puzzle is actually figuring out how to power additional drives. Spinning 3.5" drives are a bit more power hungry and it's not like there's a PSU you could plugin additional SATA power cables in.
