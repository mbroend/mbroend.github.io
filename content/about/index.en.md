I hold a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, specialized in advanced signal processing in neuroscience. I thoroughly enjoyed the subject, but traditional research just wasn’t my cup of tea. I still very much find the mind fascinating and can speak to lengths on the inner workings of learning on a neural level.

What I did enjoy was the process of transforming raw data into insights using the appropriate technique for the appropriate task. This 

I believe data science fundamentally is about problems and not about machine learning modeling.

When building solutions to solve problems I (figuratively) build skateboard before cars, because solving the real problems requires dialogue and testing, which is must easier with a product in hand and even though I’m very sure of my own abilities, I can’t build a car in a week, but I can build a skateboard 


Mathias is a swiss army data-knife with extensive experience in all areas of data & analytics. With a masters degree in biomedical engineering specialised in advanced neuroscience signal processing, Mathias has a strong fundation in applied machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and the ability to translate results of advanced data analytics into insights for stakeholders. 
With previous work experience within the field of data engineering and business intelligence, Mathias has build datawarehouses, data pipelines and customer-facing dashboards. 
This combination of experience gives Mathias a unique insight into the requirements and pitfalls of all phases of data based projects. 

With experience across many types of data projects, Mathias understands the importance of insuring technical projects translates to added business value. Mathias has proven track record of delivering data based products and turning raw data into insights and better decisions for endusers and decisions-makers. He does so by cobbling business understanding with strong technical skills and an ability to tailor communication of complex topics to both specialist and generalists alike.
