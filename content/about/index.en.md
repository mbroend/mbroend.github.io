I'm a swiss army data-knife with extensive experience across all areas of data & analytics.
I hold a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, specialized in advanced signal processing in neuroscience and eventhough I thoroughly enjoyed the subject, traditional research just wasn’t my cup of tea. I still very much find the mind fascinating and can speak to lengths on the inner workings of learning on a neural level.

What I did enjoy was the process of transforming raw data into insights using the appropriate technique for the job. This is why I believe data science fundamentally is about problems and not about machine learning modeling.


When building solutions to solve problems I (figuratively) build skateboard before cars. Because solving the real problems requires dialogue and testing, which is much easier with a product in hand and even though I’m very sure of my own abilities, I can’t build a car in a week, but I can build a skateboard.
